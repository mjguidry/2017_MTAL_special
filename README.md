# 2017_MTAL_special
New trace for MT, to make for general election

## Output files:

**MTAL.svg** - An SVG file, where every path is labeled with a county name.

**MTAL.csv** - The paths are pulled out of the SVG, this can be used for import into the DDHQ database, or as a reference for coloring the black-and-white PNG.

**MTAL_BW.png** - A black-and-white PNG that is generated from the MTAL_block_map, and is traced to create the SVG. This PNG could also be used in a coloring script, just need the corresponding CSV file as a reference. If you take the first two numbers in the CSV field, and add 0.5 to them, you can use that as the reference point for a "flood" color operation

## Generation script:

**MTAL_map_to_svg.py** - This Python script takes the MTAL_block_map.xlsx and generates the corresponding PNG and SVG files. The block map needed to be fixed by hand, so that is why this script is not combined with any others. New alternative shapes can be generated by modifying the MTAL_block_map.xlsx and re-running the script.

## Reference block map:

**MTAL_block_map.xlsx** - This XLSX file is initially auto-generated by the MTAL_draw_map.py script, which gets the map most of the way there. Unfortunately, the script is not smart enough to keep all of the blocks from the same county contiguous, so the block map must be edited by hand after generation, before the next script can operate on it. Otherwise, there will be dangling shapes.
